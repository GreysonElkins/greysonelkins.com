# Greyson Elkins Dot Com

Greyson needs a job so he whipped this up to get flashy for job listers. The project was bootstrapped with Create React App and Typescript.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

No tests are currently with the project - they will be written to test website behavior based on User interaction in a format similar to the one found in [mixdup](https://github.com/DupMix/MixDup-FE/blob/main/src/components/Navigation/Navigation.test.tsx)
